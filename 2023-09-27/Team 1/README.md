# Aim of the Project and how to run it:
this project aim is to take a non sorted list and sort it to then creat sub-lists of three elements that add up to 0 
- the list is first sorted
- the program checks for duplicates and eleminates them so that no list is repeted twice
- two pointers left and right are created to scan the list
